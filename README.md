# org.civicrm.genericsync

This project is developed as a part of _**Google Summer of Code**_ for the open source organization CiviCRM. _**GernericSync**_ is an extension which synchronizes CiviCRM contacts through mapped list/groups of Mailchimp and Constant Contact. It also helps in providing a clutter-free environment by bringing together the synchronizing feature of different email marketing services under one roof. 

## Installation
- Download the repository and place it in the CiviCRM extensions dir of your Drupal site.
- From your CiviCRM dashboard, goto Administer -> System Settings -> Manage Extensions (for CiviCRM < 4.7) or, Administer -> System Settings -> Extensions (for CiviCRM >= 4.7).
- Install GenericSync (org.civicrm.genericsync) extension.

## Usage
The Synchronization functionality can be accessed from the 'Mailings' in the navigation menu under the tab 'Generic Sync'. Before using the service the extension settings need to be configured with your Mailchimp or Constant Contact account.
